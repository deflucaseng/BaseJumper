Aatish said I missed some teammate evaluations for non-subteam members in the assignments. And with personal updates 
that I missed the first few but after I talked to him earlier in the semester about it the submissions have been solid. 
Because of that he recommended I ask you given that I am 2 points from an A in the class.
